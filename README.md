# Media File Finder -- Lift & Shift for Obs. Storage


## Description
Media File Finder is a utility written in Rust to search through a specified directory (and its subdirectories) for media files based on their extensions. Once found, it can optionally copy those files to another specified directory. The program also keeps track of relevant metrics like the number of files found, types of files, and the aggregate size for each file type.
